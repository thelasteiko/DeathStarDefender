# Death Star Defender
It's a game and stuff!
## Red One
Prototype

### Notes and clarifications:

This is the debug version. The non-debug version is at 
http://thelasteiko.github.io/DeathStarDefender/

You must select the item you want to place from the menu every time you want
to place a new item. If you cannot afford it or it is still recharging, you
cannot select it.

TIE fighters are portrayed in the menu and on the placement shadow by the battery.
This will be fixed in the next iteration.

The power total increments by 25 at regular intervals.

Batteries drop power sources which are currently portrayed by Idle Luke Skywalker.
These power sources are clickable and add to the power total.

TIE fighters shoot projectiles, which are currently portrayed by Moonwalking Luke Skywalker.
They only shoot when there is an enemy in their row.

Enemies are currently spawned at the end of a random row at regular intervals. The only
enemy currently used is Jogging Luke Skywalker.


We would like to thank Luke Skywalker for giving it his all and being such a trooper 
during this process. Not a Stormtrooper, obviously. He's a little short for that.
